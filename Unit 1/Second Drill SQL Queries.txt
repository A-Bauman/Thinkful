What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?  134 degrees F, zip 94063

SELECT 
	zip, MAX(maxtemperaturef) AS max_temp
FROM 
	weather
GROUP BY
	zip
ORDER BY
	max_temp
	

How many trips started at each station?  (query has answers)

SELECT
	start_station, COUNT(trip_id)
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY
	start_station


What's the shortest trip that happened?  60 (I assume that's seconds)
This is much better than just selecting duration and then showing by ascending order.

SELECT
	MIN(duration)
FROM
	trips



What is the average trip duration, by end station?  Again, see query.

SELECT
	end_station, AVG(duration)
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY
	end_station
