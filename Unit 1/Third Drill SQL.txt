1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
So, it turns out that there are some trips spanning several rainy days.  I had to figure out how to get a unique trip_id, which I did.  If you just run a JOIN on duration and weather (rain), you actually get back the same exact trip 3 times as your answer.

WITH unq AS 
(
	SELECT		trip_id,
			MAX(duration) AS dur
	FROM		trips
	GROUP BY	trip_id
)
	
SELECT	unq.trip_id,
	unq.dur,
	COUNT(wth.precipitationin)

FROM 	unq

JOIN	trips
ON	unq.trip_id = trips.trip_id
JOIN	weather AS wth
ON	trips.zip_code = wth.zip
WHERE 	wth.precipitationin > 0

GROUP BY unq.trip_id, unq.dur
ORDER BY dur DESC	
LIMIT 10


2. Which station is full most often?  Looks like Santa Clara at Almaden.

WITH nope AS
-- count when docks_available = 0, meaning station is full;
(
	SELECT		station_id,
			COUNT(docks_available) AS unavail
	FROM		status
	WHERE		docks_available = 0
	GROUP BY 	station_id
)
SELECT		nope.unavail,
		stations.name
FROM		nope

-- do joins to translate station_id to actual station names
JOIN		status
ON		nope.station_id = status.station_id
JOIN		stations
ON		status.station_id = stations.station_id
GROUP BY 	stations.name, nope.unavail
ORDER BY 	nope.unavail DESC
LIMIT 10


3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but 
ordered by dock count.

WITH trp AS
(
	SELECT	COUNT(trip_id) AS cnt, 
		start_station
	FROM	trips
	GROUP BY start_station
)
SELECT	stations.dockcount AS "DOCKS",
	trp.cnt AS "TRIP COUNT",
	trips.start_station AS "STARTING STATION"
FROM	trp
JOIN	trips
ON	trp.start_station = trips.start_station

-- uncomment below if you want to include stations without
-- docks (and obviously comment out JOIN...)
--LEFT JOIN	stations
JOIN	stations
ON	trips.start_station = stations.name

GROUP BY trips.start_station, trp.cnt, stations.dockcount
ORDER BY stations.dockcount DESC
LIMIT 100


4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

WITH wth AS
(
	SELECT	wth.date,
		COUNT(precipitationin) AS any_rn
	FROM	weather AS wth
	WHERE 	wth.precipitationin > 0
	GROUP BY
		wth.date
),

trp AS
(
	SELECT	MAX(duration) AS dur,
		start_date
	FROM	trips
	GROUP BY
		start_date
)

SELECT  wth.date, MAX(trp.dur) AS max_dur
FROM	wth
JOIN	trp
ON	date(wth.date) = date(start_date)
GROUP BY
	wth.date
ORDER BY
	max_dur DESC
