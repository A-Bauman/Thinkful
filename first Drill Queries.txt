The IDs and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration:

SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration
FROM
	trips
WHERE
	duration > 500
ORDER BY
	duration DESC



Every column of the stations table for station id 84:

SELECT
	*
FROM
	stations
WHERE
	station_id = 84



The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301:

SELECT
	mintemperaturef
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	precipitationin > 0 AND
	zip = 94301

I also ran this below, because the query above returned nothing. Indeed, there's nothing.

SELECT
	mintemperaturef,
	precipitationin,
	zip
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	precipitationin > 0
